# Tests

## Connectors

- Check if it's possible to extend the tracking module reach with FFC ribbons
- Check if tracking will work with only one FFC connected

## Gyroscope

- Check if it's possible to use tracking with different gyroscope position
- Check if it's possible to use tracking with gyroscope disabled
- Check if it's possible to use tracking without disabling the gyroscope but with gyroscope desoldered

## Sensors

- Check if tracking will work with sensors only on one side

## Components

- Check for the minimal component configuration required to run tracking

- Power button is not required. Controller will power on when USB cable is plugged in
- Battery is not required but there can be loss of tracking if USB voltage is unstable
- Check if battery can be bypassed with direct voltage to the pins
- Absolutely needs the Touchpad board for it to work

## Software

- Doesn't require Dongle. Works over USB
- While using USB, lower quality cables will result in tracking losses or no tracking at all
- Works best with Dongle
- Works as tracker after JSON changes

## Mechanical

### Check which material can be used for sensor coverings

- Floppy disks don't work
