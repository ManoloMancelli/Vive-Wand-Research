# Tests

## Connectors

- Check if it's possible to extend the tracking module reach with FFC ribbons
- Check if tracking will work with only one FFC connected

## Gyroscope

- Check if it's possible to use tracking with different gyroscope position
- Check if it's possible to use tracking with gyroscope disabled
- Check if it's possible to use tracking without disabling the gyroscope but with gyroscope desoldered

## Sensors

- Check if tracking will work with sensors only on one side

## Components

- Check for the minimal component configuration required to run tracking

## Mechanical

- Check which material can be used for sensor coverings
